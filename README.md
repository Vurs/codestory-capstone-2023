# Capstone Coding Teacher
A game that aims to teach children and teenagers the basics of coding.

Using Unity version **2022.3.6f1 LTS**.

# What to do after cloning the latest build to your local PC
Some configuration will be needed to be performed after cloning the project to your own computer, every time. Here's what needs to be done:
1. Open Unity Hub and open/locate the cloned folder called "capstone-coding-teacher"
2. After letting Unity Hub discover the project, open it from within Unity Hub
3. After the project finishes loading, you'll be presented with a blank scene. Open the folder called "Scenes" within the Unity Editor and open the scene of your choice
4. After the project is cloned it will always change the platform to the default platform which is PC, but we want it to be iOS or Android. Go to File > Build Settings > Click either iOS or Android > Switch Platform
5. Done! It should be looking good now with no out-of-place UI elements
